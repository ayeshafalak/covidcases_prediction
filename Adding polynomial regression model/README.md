**PROJECT TITLE**

Adding polynomial regression model


**DATASET**

COVID19


**WHAT I HAD DONE** 

I use the  polynomial regression to predict the COVID19 confirmed cases.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

Pandas
Numpy
sklearn

**Score**

By using Polynomial Regression I got 
 ```python
    score - 0.3342205018113914
 ``` 
 
**Conclusion**

- In Polynomial Regression when we increase our Degree it reduce the Root mean Squared error and improve our score also in compare to Linear  Regression but we cannot increase the Degree of Polynomial to much because it increase the variance.So the Polynomial Regression model is ready to run.
