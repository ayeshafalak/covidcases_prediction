## PROJECT TITLE: Prediction of Daily Covid Cases with Decision Tree Regression

### DATASET :

COVID19 (state_wise_daily.csv)

### WHAT I HAVE DONE:

I have used the DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn.tree library for the prediction of number of cases on a daily bases.


### LIBRARIES USED:

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn

### SCORE:
#### The overall accuracy was 98.36%

### CONCLUSION:

The visualization shows the curve fitting quite accurately on the test data.
